## What does this website do?

Shorten URLs and attach self-destructing messages

After the first visit of the shorted URL, the message becomes visible and destroys itself

Every other visit redirects to the original URL

## Why?

By hiding secret messages behind URLs, it is possible to deny the sending of that message afterward

From an outside perspective, it's just a shortened URL
